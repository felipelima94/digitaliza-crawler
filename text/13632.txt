PREREQUISITES

In order to make the most of this, you will need to have
alittle bit of programming experience. All examples in this
book are in the Python programming language. Familiarity
with Python or other scripting languages is suggested, but
not required.

You'll also need to know some basic mathematics. This
book is hands-on and example driven: lots of examples and
lots of code, so even if your math skills are not up to par,
do not worry! The examples are very detailed and heavily
documented to help you follow along.
